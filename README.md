# ReactNativePractice

This is my personal notes of learning React Native - some practice demo
## demo 1: a stopwatch
Learn how to use React Native only to write a little demo and how to refactor it with React Native & Redux. Had a better feeling of the difference of two usages. Using React Native only requires clear vertical relationship of each component in order to find right component to set state. With help of Redux makes things easier. RN deals with view rendering, and whenever user does something, it creates an action and dispatches the action to reducers to handle.

## demo 2: twitter entrance animation
Learn how to use TabBarIOS and Icon.TabBarItem. Learn how to use ScrollView with RefreshControl. Learn how to use Animated library to add logo transforming animation effect when opening the app. Pretty fun!
